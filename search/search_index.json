As the newest lab in SciEcon, the Blockchain+ lab aims to host a feast of intellectual conversations where research affiliates discuss exploratory research with distinguished panelists centered around the cutting-edge topic of \u201cBlockchain+\u201d that connects blockchain to real-world applications and identify promising open questions for future explorations and collaborations. We will publish our symposium documentary as Open Educational Resources (OER) on Medium and Web 3.0. Background of the Core Research Topic of the Lab The core research topic centers on the applications of Blockchain in different areas. The first paper, Josh Manto, is centered on the applications of blockchain to decentralize the cloud computing field. The second paper, by Yutong Sun, focuses on the application of blockchain to supply chains and finance risk identification. The third paper by Tingyu Cai is about how blockchain can solve problems found in supply chains. The fourth paper by Yuming Gong features a proposal for a blockchain-based social media platform. The fifth paper by Yuxi Jiang features an analysis on how blockchain can solve financial fraud, and the last paper by Yu Cheng aims to understand how blockchain can revolutionize the financial industry. Lab Project Overview The project aims to understand and showcase the applications of blockchain to the field of cloud technology, the financial industry and anti-fraud tactics, social media, and the supply chain. Symposium Sketch The symposium comprises online presentations and discussion for 6 articles. Each presentation lasts 6 minutes, with around 20 minutes of panel discussion allotted after the presentation. Before the article presentations, SciEcon Lab Incubator Program Committee gives a short opening remarks on the SciEcon Symposium and SciEcon Lab Incubator Program. The Address Guest Speaker gives a presentation on one of the most popular promising applications of Blockchain, Metaverse. Symposium Agenda A Blockchain-based Decentralized Cloud Storage with \u201cKeeper-and-Distributor\u201d Systems Author : Josh Manto Title : Decentralizing the Cloud by Implementing Blockchain and \u201cKeeper-and-Distributor\u201d Systems Medium Article Publication : NOT YET PUBLISHED Abstract : The majority of cloud computing services today are managed and owned by major tech companies. Two major cybersecurity risks arise with cloud computing centralization: first, user data privacy issues, such as the unlawful selling of user data to third parties, and second, overall data security such as data breaches and hacks. In this paper, I propose a decentralized cloud storage model built on the blockchain that has a \u201ckeeper-and-distributor\u201d system. This model is more secure due to its \u201ckeeper-and-distributor\u201d feature and is able to respect user data privacy because the data audit trail is stored and accessible in the blockchain. Blockchain Applications on the Supply Chain Author : Tingyu Cai Title : Popularly-claimed Advantages and Followed-up Suspicions Regarding the Real Applicability and Effectiveness Medium Article Publication : NOT YET PUBLISHED Abstract : The supply chain is a vital network for business production and delivery from suppliers to consumers. Due to the centralized architecture of its management system and the complicated process of transactions involving numerous intermediaries, the global supply chain has long been troubled by inefficiency and misconduct. Blockchain technology, on the other hand, has been popularly viewed as a promising tool to solve the supply chain problem due to its unique mechanism that brings transparency, security, and efficiency to the network. However, this article significantly argues that it might be too early to draw the conclusion that blockchain will guarantee a good performance after implementing it in the supply chain. In fact, it is even too early to conclude that blockchain can be successfully adopted by a fair number of firms and with proper scale. The paper first summarizes two key types of supply chain problems and the application potential of blockchain technology to solve them, and then proposes four fundamental questions as suspicions on real applicability and effectiveness. In the end, a list of potential future research directions will be presented. The Imperative development and Challenges of Blockchain Technology in Finance Author : Yu Cheng Title : The Imperative development and Challenges of Blockchain Technology in Finance Medium Article Publication : NOT YET PUBLISHED Abstract : The concept \"blockchain\" originated from the decentralized public ledger technology of Bitcoin. Even in its infancy, blockchain technology has demonstrated its power to revolutionize various industries. Decentralization, transparency, and immutability are appealing to businesses across the world, but finance is leading the way in terms of the implementation of blockchain technology. In the process of exploring the application of blockchain, challenges and problems will inevitably arise at the same time. Possible Improvements Made by Blockchain Technology to Social Media Author : Yuming Gong Title : Possible Improvements Made by Blockchain Technology to Social Media Medium Article Publication : NOT YET PUBLISHED Abstract : At present, with the rapid development of Internet information technology, social media and their large amount of information are showing explosive growth. At the same time, traditional social media has been utilized as a tool to spread fake news and misinformation, which brings with it other issues such as privacy security and information authenticity. There should be some solutions to ensure data security and to fact-check the information disseminated in the platform. It is foreseeable that the application of blockchain technology may trigger a new round of reform in the social media industry. This paper aims to summarize some drawbacks of traditional social media and explore how blockchain technology can be used as a tool to curb the spread of fake news and personal privacy as well as regulating and holding people accountable for these social problems. At the end of the paper, a case study is used explore the feasibility of applying blockchain technology to current social media industry Supply Chain Finance Risk Identification and the Corrective Role of Blockchain Author : Yutong Sun Title : Supply Chain Finance Risk Identification and the Corrective Role of Blockchain Medium Article Publication : NOT YET PUBLISHED Abstract : The supply chain is an essential and important link in the production and distribution process, which revolves around the core companies, links upstream and downstream suppliers and distributors, and involves regulators and financial institutions, connecting them in a chain. Because supply chain financial service involves several enterprises and financial institutions, its risk is transmitted upstream and downstream with the trade between enterprises in the supply chain, making the risk cover the whole supply chain from a single enterprise. And blockchain, because of its transparent, irreversible, and open information characteristics, can be used to design supply chain information-sharing mechanisms, consensus mechanisms, and incentive mechanisms to help solve the potential risk problem of the supply chain. This paper summarizes and concludes the potential risks of the supply chain system after an extensive literature review, and analyzes how to use the functions and advantages of blockchain to correct these risks one by one. And at the end, a blockchain application scenario of a commercial bank in China is provided as a case study. Analysis of the possibilities and difficulties of using blockchain technology: Is blockchain technology effective enough to prevent the occurrence of financial fraud? Author : Yuxi Jiang Title : Analysis of the possibilities and difficulties of using blockchain technology: Is blockchain technology effective enough to prevent the occurrence of financial fraud? Medium Article Publication : NOT YET PUBLISHED Abstract : In recent years, financial fraud has been a shared network problem that endangers individuals, enterprises, and institutions' psychology, reputation, and property safety. As an emerging technology, blockchain has the advantages of information stability and data confidentiality brought by decentralization. I will explore the possibilities and difficulties of blockchain applications in financial anti-fraud by combining the case of Everledger and JD.COM in diamond supply chain tracking and the related literature review.
