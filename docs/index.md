## **Overview**

### Symposium Background

This seminar is hosted by the SciEcon Lab Incubator Program Committee, supervised by Professor Luyao Zhang, and proposed by the Blockchain + lab leaders: Josh Manto and Yutong Sun. As the newest lab in SciEcon, the Blockchain+ lab aims to host a feast of intellectual conversations where research affiliates discuss exploratory research with distinguished panelists centered around the cutting-edge topic of “Blockchain+” that connects blockchain to real-world applications and identify promising open questions for future explorations and collaborations. We will publish our symposium documentary as Open Educational Resources (OER) on Medium and Web 3.0.

### Background of the Core Research Topic of the Lab

The core research topic centers on the applications of Blockchain in different areas. The first paper, Josh Manto, is centered on the applications of blockchain to decentralize the cloud computing field. The second paper, by Yutong Sun, focuses on the application of blockchain to supply chains and finance risk identification. The third paper by Tingyu Cai is about how blockchain can solve problems found in supply chains. The fourth paper by Yuming Gong features a proposal for a blockchain-based social media platform. The fifth paper by Yuxi Jiang features an analysis on how blockchain can solve financial fraud, and the last paper by Yu Cheng aims to understand how blockchain can revolutionize the financial industry. 

### Lab Project Overview

### [A Blockchain-based Decentralized Cloud Storage with “Keeper-and-Distributor” Systems](./articles/1_josh.md)

**Author**: Josh Manto

**Title**: Decentralizing the Cloud by Implementing Blockchain and “Keeper-and-Distributor” Systems

**Medium Article Publication**: NOT YET PUBLISHED

**Abstract**: The majority of cloud computing services today are managed and owned by major tech companies. Two major cybersecurity risks arise with cloud computing centralization: first, user data privacy issues, such as the unlawful selling of user data to third parties, and second, overall data security such as data breaches and hacks. In this paper, I propose a decentralized cloud storage model built on the blockchain that has a “keeper-and-distributor” system. This model is more secure due to its “keeper-and-distributor” feature and is able to respect user data privacy because the data audit trail is stored and accessible in the blockchain.

### Blockchain Applications on the Supply Chain

**Author**: Tingyu Cai

**Title**: Popularly-claimed Advantages and Followed-up Suspicions Regarding the Real Applicability and Effectiveness

**Medium Article Publication**: NOT YET PUBLISHED 

**Abstract**: The supply chain is a vital network for business production and delivery from suppliers to consumers. Due to the centralized architecture of its management system and the complicated process of transactions involving numerous intermediaries, the global supply chain has long been troubled by inefficiency and misconduct. Blockchain technology, on the other hand, has been popularly viewed as a promising tool to solve the supply chain problem due to its unique mechanism that brings transparency, security, and efficiency to the network. However, this article significantly argues that it might be too early to draw the conclusion that blockchain will guarantee a good performance after implementing it in the supply chain. In fact, it is even too early to conclude that blockchain can be successfully adopted by a fair number of firms and with proper scale. The paper first summarizes two key types of supply chain problems and the application potential of blockchain technology to solve them, and then proposes four fundamental questions as suspicions on real applicability and effectiveness. In the end, a list of potential future research directions will be presented.

**Title**: The Imperative development and Challenges of Blockchain Technology in Finance 

**Medium Article Publication**: NOT YET PUBLISHED

**Abstract**: The concept "blockchain" originated from the decentralized public ledger technology of Bitcoin. Even in its infancy, blockchain technology has demonstrated its power to revolutionize various industries. Decentralization, transparency, and immutability are appealing to businesses across the world, but finance is leading the way in terms of the implementation of blockchain technology. In the process of exploring the application of blockchain, challenges and problems will inevitably arise at the same time.

### Possible Improvements Made by Blockchain Technology to Social Media

**Author**: Yuming Gong

**Title**: Possible Improvements Made by Blockchain Technology to Social Media

**Medium Article Publication**: NOT YET PUBLISHED

**Abstract**: At present, with the rapid development of Internet information technology, social media and their large amount of information are showing explosive growth. At the same time, traditional social media has been utilized as a tool to spread fake news and misinformation, which brings with it other issues such as privacy security and information authenticity. There should be some solutions to ensure data security and to fact-check the information disseminated in the platform. It is foreseeable that the application of blockchain technology may trigger a new round of reform in the social media industry. This paper aims to summarize some drawbacks of traditional social media and explore how blockchain technology can be used as a tool to curb the spread of fake news and personal privacy as well as regulating and holding people accountable for these social problems. At the end of the paper, a case study is used explore the feasibility of applying blockchain technology to current social media industry

### Supply Chain Finance Risk Identification and the Corrective Role of Blockchain

**Author**: Yutong Sun

**Title**: Supply Chain Finance Risk Identification and the Corrective Role of Blockchain

**Medium Article Publication**: NOT YET PUBLISHED 

**Abstract**: The supply chain is an essential and important link in the production and distribution process, which revolves around the core companies, links upstream and downstream suppliers and distributors, and involves regulators and financial institutions, connecting them in a chain. Because supply chain financial service involves several enterprises and financial institutions, its risk is transmitted upstream and downstream with the trade between enterprises in the supply chain, making the risk cover the whole supply chain from a single enterprise. And blockchain, because of its transparent, irreversible, and open information characteristics, can be used to design supply chain information-sharing mechanisms, consensus mechanisms, and incentive mechanisms to help solve the potential risk problem of the supply chain. This paper summarizes and concludes the potential risks of the supply chain system after an extensive literature review, and analyzes how to use the functions and advantages of blockchain to correct these risks one by one. And at the end, a blockchain application scenario of a commercial bank in China is provided as a case study.
